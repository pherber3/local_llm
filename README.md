nothing yet so todo list:
TODO: 
- Add an attach thing next to send that lets you pick a file and upload it and add it to the context of the conversation just for that session.
- Make the generation streamed instead of nothing and then everything at once
- Add an export button that alllows you to export a json saved conversation as a similarly formatted file
- Need to make when it goes to retrieve code smarter, like right now the keyword matching is sorta ok but if i ask it to generate random code for instance, it would take "code" and then go look in the code base even though it doesn't need to.
